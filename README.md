## Project Description
Imagine if you could create your own governments, communities, and your very own currencies in a truly open world that changes dynamically based on every other player in the world.

Our project is a 2D top-down open world game that anyone could participate as a player or builder or even both! We have created basic functions like spawning, movements, mining resources, crafting, combating for the game. We aim to create main quest line, multiplayer system like communication tools and governance system for people with roles to manage their guilds and villages in future to enhance the gaming experience.

The goal of the game is to restore modern civilization starting by using basic natural resources, craft basic tools to build primeval buildings and civilization. The game is expected to go through different revolutions like stone ages to middle ages to modern ages as players progress.

Any creative developers will be able to build side quests, mini games or life simulation systems on top of this world!

## How it's Made
Using MUD as main framework for writing smart contracts in Solidity + integration with frontends. Every smart contract is deployed on our own game-specific L2 network created using OP Stack.

Phaser is used as our frontend client and game engine to power the game. Graphics like characters, sprites animations and background tiles are from itch.io.
